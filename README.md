# Pytest tutorial

This repository contains the initial setup for the "TDD in Python with pytest" workshop.

The `Project.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook with the description of the project.

The `tutorial.py` file contains the tests that shall be added to the `tests/test_dictregister.py` file, while the `code.py` file contains the solutions, i.e. the code that passes the tests.
